## 1) What is it?
Records actions or events in games into a continuous 'Log' on a frame-by-frame basis using RingBuffers only.


## 2) When to use it:
* You want to log data on a frame-by-frame basis.
* You want to log certain actions or events for display.
* You want different systems to access actions or events without relying on C#-events or callbacks. 

Reason: In our games we sometimes don't want to calculate everything in one frame but rather just _log_ that something has happened to then later let other systems simply look it up and process it. A good example would be if a player takes a hit from a monster: different Effects or Skills might want to react to _"Player is taking 5 damage"_ but doing all that on the same frame might lead to lag or stutter in which case the `ActionLog` might be able to help you.

## 3) How it works
The `ActionLog` keeps a RingBuffer of your frames. Once the RingBuffer is full the oldest entry will be overwritten. The `ActionLog` also keeps RingBuffers for the actions of each frame you want to log which will also overwrite the oldest entry once the actions' RingBuffer is full. For better understanding see image below:

## 4) How to ...?

### 4.1) Create a new ActionLog
```
int frameCapacity = 7;
int actionCapacity = 4;
int actionBufferCapacity = 5;

ActionLogInt actionLog = new ActionLogInt(frameCapacity, actionCapacity, actionBufferCapacity);
```
Explanation: 
* With a _frameCapacity_ of 7 we can keep track of up to 7 frames before the oldest one will be overwritten. 
* With an _actionCapacity_ of 4 we can log 4 different actions or events for every frame. 
* With an _actionBufferCapacity_ of 5 we can make 5 entries for each(!!!) action before the oldest one will be overwritten.

Note: The _actionCapacity_ also dictates the _actionIds_ for the actions you want to add. An _actionCapacity_ of 7 will give you the _actionIds_ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. An _actionCapacity_ of 4 will give you the _actionIds_ 0, 1, 2 and 3.


### 4.2) Add a new frame to the ActionLog
```
ulong newFrame = 9999L;
actionLog.AddFrame(newFrame);
```
This will add a new frame to the ActionLog.


### 4.3) Add an action to the current frame
```
int actionId = 2;
int actionData = 15;
actionLog.AddAction(actionId, actionData);
```
This will add the action to the current frame.


### 4.4) Add an action to a previous frame
```
ulong firstFrame = 9998L;
actionLog.AddFrame(firstFrame);

ulong secondFrame = 9999L;
actionLog.AddFrame(secondFrame);

int actionId = 2;
int actionData = 15;
actionLog.AddAction(firstFrame, actionId, actionData);
```
This will add the action to the specified frame.


### 4.5) Add an action to the current frame or create a new frame automatically
```
ulong frame = 9999L;
int actionId = 2;
int actionData = 15;
actionLog.Add(frame, actionId, actionData);
```
If the specified frame is the current frame the action will be added to it, else a new frame with the action will automatically be added.

This is the easiest and preferred way of adding actions to the `ActionLog`!


### 4.6) Read logged actions (Method 1)
```
int actionId = 2:
actionLog.AddAction(actionId, 22);
actionLog.AddAction(actionId, 44);
actionLog.AddAction(actionId, 66);

RingBufferInt buffer = actionLog.GetActionsBuffer(actionId);
for (int i = 0; i < buffer.Count; i++) {
    Debug.Log("Recorded action data: " + buffer[i]);
}
```
By receiving a shallow copy of the `RingBufferInt` we can simply iterate through its collection to receive all actions that have been added.


### 4.7) Read logged actions (Method 2)
```
int actionId = 2:
actionLog.AddAction(actionId, 22);
actionLog.AddAction(actionId, 44);
actionLog.AddAction(actionId, 66);

int[] index = actionLog.GetActionsIndex(actionId);
for (int i = 0; i < actionLog.Actions[index[0], index[1]].Count; i++) {
    Debug.Log("Recorded action data: " + actionLog.Actions[index[0], index[1]][i]);
}
```
By receiving the multidimensional index of where the `RingBufferInt` is located inside the `ActionLogInt.Actions` we can directly access it and do not need to produce any shallow copies of it.


## 5) Closure
Currently supported types:
* `ActionLogByte`
* `ActionLogByteArray`
* `ActionLogShort`
* `ActionLogShortArray`
* `ActionLogInt`
* `ActionLogIntArray`
* `ActionLogFloat`
* `ActionLogFloatArray`
* `ActionLogString`
* `ActionLogStringArray`

The classes provided have no generic implementation as they have been code-generated by a personal project of mine to be open-sourced here. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. You are encouraged to change the code to your needs.

Hope this helps you! :)
